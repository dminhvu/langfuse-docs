# Offline Evaluations

This is a step by step guide on how to create your first dataset and run your first offline experiment. Please refer to the [overview](/docs/datasets/overview) for more conceptual introduction.

If you want to test a single prompt, you can use [Prompt Experiments](/docs/evaluation/features/prompt-experiments) which does not require any code.
